            <h2>Products and <span>Services</span></h2>
           <p>The CadEduKit product/service offerings begins with the development of the PES or Personality Essence System. Currently, agents are the focus of intense interest on the part of many subfields of computer science and artificial intelligence. Agents are being used in an increasingly wide variety of applications, ranging from comparatively small systems such as email filters to large, open, complex, mission critical systems such as air traffic control.  Our aim is to build an ontology and methodology such that our intelligent agent will make autonomous decision to match personality and vocation.</p>
           <p>And lastly but not least, is our progressive education component. It is a pedagogical movement that began in the late nineteenth century; it has persisted in various forms to the present. The term progressive was engaged to distinguish this education from the traditional Euro-American curricula of the 19th century, which was rooted in classical preparation for the university and strongly differentiated by social class. By contrast, progressive education finds its roots in present experience. Most progressive education programs have these qualities in common:</p>
           <ul>
                <li>Emphasis on learning by doing - hands-on projects, expeditionary learning, experiential learning</li>
                <li>Integrated curriculum focused on thematic units</li>
                <li>Integration of entrepreneurship into education</li>
                <li>Strong emphasis on problem solving and critical thinking</li>
                <li>Group work and development of social skills</li>
                <li>Understanding and action as the goals of learning as opposed to rote knowledge</li>
                <li>Collaborative and cooperative learning projects</li>
                <li>Education for social responsibility and democracy</li>
                <li>Highly personalized education accounting for each individual's personal goals</li>
                <li>Integration of community service and service learning projects into the daily curriculum</li>
                <li>Selection of subject content by looking forward to ask what skills will be needed in future society</li>
                <li>De-emphasis on textbooks in favor of varied learning resources</li>
                <li>Emphasis on lifelong learning and social skills</li>
                <li>Assessment by evaluation of child's projects and productions</li>
				<li>Leverage Cloud Infrastructure to build a secured, efficient and scalable web based Personal Essence System (PES).  Implement Autonomous Intelligent Agents to evaluate results that will assist Institutions of Learning with course recommendation and HR with hiring candidates</li>
           </ul>
